catit puts the subgrammars into adacs.slr and adacs.ilalr
slrit runs slr on adacs.slr
lalrit run ilalr on adacs.ilalr

The grammar is far more relaxed than required. That is, it will accept 
constructs which some may not consider grammatically corrert. 
For instance, expression are allowed on the left hand side of an assignment.


In object declarations, which types can be anonymous (arrays can for sure).


The grammar should be Ada/CS complete. Not Ada83 (a few things are missing, 
named parameters in a subprogram call for instance).

The names of non-terminals are poor and will be cleaned up.


<name> covers: 

logical operators mixing not enforced.
unary adding op not in.
