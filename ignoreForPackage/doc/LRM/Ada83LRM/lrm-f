                F. Implementation-Dependent Characteristics    

This appendix is not part of the standard definition of the Ada programming
language. 

The  Ada  language  definition  allows for certain machine-dependences in a
controlled manner. No machine-dependent syntax or  semantic  extensions  or
restrictions  are  allowed.   The  only  allowed implementation-dependences
correspond to  implementation-dependent  pragmas  and  attributes,  certain
machine-dependent  conventions  as  mentioned  in  chapter  13, and certain
allowed restrictions on representation clauses. 

The reference manual of each Ada implementation must  include  an  appendix
(called   Appendix   F)   that   describes   all   implementation-dependent
characteristics.  The appendix F for a given implementation  must  list  in
particular: 

(1)  The form, allowed places, and effect of every implementation-dependent
     pragma. 

(2)  The name and the type of every implementation-dependent attribute. 

(3)  The specification of the package SYSTEM. 

(4)  The list of all restrictions on representation clauses (see 13.1) 

(5)  The conventions used for any  implementation-generated  name  denoting
     implementation-dependent components (see 13.4). 

(6)  The interpretation of expressions  that  appear  in  address  clauses,
     including those for interrupts (see 13.5). 

(7)  Any restriction on unchecked conversions (see 13.10.2). 

(8)  Any  implementation-dependent  characteristics  of  the   input-output
     packages (see 14).
