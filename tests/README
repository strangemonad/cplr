Test Cases

Tests are divided by major features. The filename convention 
is feature_correct.ad[bs] and feature_incorrect.ad[bs].

Where the file name isn't sufficiently self-descriptive comments are added to
the individual test cases.

TODO:

There isn't a test suite harness yet. But then again, there isn't a working
compiler yet so an automated test harness wouldn't be of much use.
